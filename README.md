# Smart Health Risk Predictor
This project predicts the risk of four major health diseases using machine-learning models:
->Diabetes
->Heart Disease
->Stroke
->Lung Cancer

Each model is trained using real-world healthcare datasets and saved as .pkl files for direct use in applications like Streamlit or Desktop GUIs.

🚀 Features

✔ Predicts risk for four diseases with trained ML models
✔ Fully reproducible Jupyter notebooks
✔ Clean dataset preprocessing & feature engineering
✔ Random Forest
✔ Deployment-ready .pkl model files
✔ Can be integrated with Streamlit 

🧠 ML Workflow

Each notebook includes:

1.Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
2.Label Encoding & Feature Selection
3.Model Building - (Random Forest)
4.Performance Evaluation
5.Saving the Model (joblib pickle)
